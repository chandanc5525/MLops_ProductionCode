# MLOps_ProductionCode

---

## Objective
---
The objective of this project is to provide a complete, hands-on learning experience in Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). The bootcamp guides learners through all critical stages of the ML lifecycle â€” from data ingestion and preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring in production environments.
---
## About the Bootcamp
---
This bootcamp is structured to help individuals gain practical knowledge and implementation skills in MLOps, progressing from basic concepts to advanced production workflows. It includes modular code for each pipeline stage, use of version control, Docker for containerization, and CI/CD integration. The goal is to help learners understand how to build, deploy, monitor, and maintain ML systems efficiently.

## Significance of Each Component

| Path                        | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `components/`               | Core pipeline steps: data handling, model training, evaluation, and deployment. |
| `pipeline/`                 | Orchestrates full training and prediction workflows. |
| `configuration/`            | Handles configuration management. |
| `constants/`                | Stores constant values used across the project. |
| `entity/`                   | Defines structured classes for configuration and artifact management. |
| `exception/`                | Custom exception handling for better error tracking. |
| `logger/`                   | Central logging utility to capture pipeline logs. |
| `utils/`                    | Helper functions and reusable utility logic. |
| `config/`                   | YAML files for schema validation and model configuration. |
| `app.py`                    | REST API entry point for model inference. |
| `demo.py`                   | Script to test the entire pipeline. |
| `requirements.txt`          | Python dependencies required for the project. |
| `Dockerfile`                | Used to containerize the project for consistent deployment. |
| `.dockerignore`             | Prevents unnecessary files from being copied into Docker image. |
| `setup.py`                  | Enables packaging and installation as a Python module. |
| `README.md`                 | Project documentation and usage guide. |
